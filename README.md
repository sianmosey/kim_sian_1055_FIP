All images excluding social icons, were designed by Sian Kim (me)

Last semester, I and Ying Yang were a team. 
I was in charge of design, she was a developer.
You can check it through the name of branches in her repository on github. 

So I decided to redisgn the website for the brand of beer, Muskoka, using images that i designed.
